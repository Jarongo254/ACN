### Introduction

- Biological systems => Multiple interacting components
- Components:
    - Are not isolated
    - levels are affected by interactions
    - Form cohesive subsystems that perform specific tasks
    - Are spatially organized(cellular structures)
    - Their spatio-temporal interactions result in biological system features.

- Function of a component can be inferred from its interactions.
- Network theory and mathematical modeling are used to analyze interactions.

### Network theory

Graph: abstract representation of a set of components(nodes/vertices) where some components are connected by edges.

**Formal definition**: Graph is a pair $G = (V,E)$ such that $E \subseteq \{\{u,v\} \mid u,v \in V\}$. $V$ is the set of nodes and $E$ is the set of edges.


In context of biology:
- nodes: genes, proteins, metabolites, regulatory elements, cells, species, etc.
- edges: interactions, relations, dependencies, etc.

Network can be:
- directed or undirected
- weighted or unweighted
- simple or multigraph

For a given graph $G(V,E)$:
- Number of nodes $n = |V(G)|$
- Number of edges $m = |E(G)|$

* **Parallel edges**: two edges connect the same pair of vertices (forms a multi-edge).
* **Loops**: an edge connecting a vertex to itself.
* **Simple graph**: a graph with no parallel edges and no loops.
* **Multigraph**: a graph with parallel edges and loops.

* Weighted directed hypergraph - Nodes connected to subset of nodes

#### Graph representation on computers
* Adjacency matrix - constant time to check for an edge between two nodes
  - $A[u,v] = 1$ if $\{u,v\} \in E(G)$
  - $A[u,v] = 0$ if $\{u,v\} \notin E(G)$
  - Matrix is symmetric for a non directed graph but not for directed
* Incidence matrix
  - $A[u,e] = 1$ if $u \in E(G)$
  - $A[u,e] = 0$ if $u \notin E$
* Adjacency list - To each node, a list of neighbors/connected nodes

#### Walk
Alternating sequence of nodes and edges.

**Formally**: Let $G = (V,E)$ be a simple graph. A sequence $W = (v_1, e_1, v_2, \dots, e_{k-1}, v_k)$ with $v_i \in V(G)$, $1 \leq i \leq k$ and $e_i = \{v_i, v_{i+1}\} \in E(G)$, $1 \leq i \leq k-1$ is called a walk.
